    <string name="recognition">Professional recognition</string>
    <string name="recognition_details">A kite mark of our global distinction and rigorous academic teaching is reflected in our accreditation from the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET), under licence from the UK regulator, the Engineering Council. Our accreditation is a mark of assurance that the degree meets the standards set by the Engineering Council in the UK Standard for Professional Engineering Competence (UK-SPEC).

An accredited degree provides you with some or all of the underpinning knowledge, understanding and skills for eventual registration as an Incorporated (IEng) or Chartered Engineer (CEng).  Some employers recruit preferentially from accredited degrees and an accredited degree is likely to be recognised by other countries that are signatories to international accords. Our programmes in Computer Systems Engineering and Electronic and Communications Engineering provide a broad grounding in these fields.

Engineering Programmes at Kent have been continuously accredited by the IET for over 30 years. The School of Engineering and Digital Arts is an IET Academic Partner.

The School has several visiting industrial professors who contribute to the strong industrial relevance of our programmes.</string>
